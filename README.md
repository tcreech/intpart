### What is intpart for? ###

* Silly but unfortunately necessary code for creating an integer partition given certain constraints.

### Can you give an example? ###

* Say you have 16 discrete resources, and you want to partition them up among 4 users at arbitrary ratios respecting fractions ( 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 1/4 ). `intpart`  can help you to create an *integer* partitioning of 16 which best respects this goal.
